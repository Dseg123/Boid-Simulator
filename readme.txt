Boid Simulator: Uses space-partitioning kd-trees to perform an efficient k-nearest neighbor search and produce emergently complex boid movement.

Important classes:
- Run RangeSearchVisualizer to test the kd-tree 2-D range search functionality
- Run NearestNeighborVisualizer to test the kd-tree 2-D single nearest neighbor functionality
- Run BoidSimulator to run the boid simulation; modify parameters in the code like FRIENDS (the number of neighbors tracked) to see different behavior

Many sample files and expected outputs are also included.
